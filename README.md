OF Protocol Library
===================

This is an **OpenFlow Protocol** library implemented in Erlang. It was created
for the purpose of an **OpenFlow software switch** called [LINC][linc-repo], but
can be used in any Erlang projects requiring supports for this protocol.

It has full support for [OpenFlow Protocol 1.3][ofp4] and
[OpenFlow Protocol 1.2][ofp3].

Initial backward compatibility for [OpenFlow Protocol 1.0][ofp1] and
[OpenFlow Protocol 1.1][ofp2] was dropped to support the evolution of the
OpenFlow standard.
